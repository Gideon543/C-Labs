The dimensions of wooden blocks are given in a data ﬁle, dataBlocks.dat and gives for each block the width (W) 
and height (H) of its base and the length (L) of the block. 

The problem is simply to read these blocks and store them ﬁrst as an array of blocks of rectangular objects of a class rectBlocks(). 
From the class of rectangular blocks, there are some whose base width equals the base height (i.e., W = H). 
Call these the square base rectangles, sqrBaseRectBlocks(). 
Generate an array of only the blocks with square bases as a derived class of rectBlocks(). 

From the class of sqrBaseRectBlock(), two other classes may be derived; 
one with W = H = L, call this the cuboidBlocks() and another, formed as cylindrical blocks, 
where the square base is formed into a circle with diameter the same as the width or height of the square base. 
Call these objects of the cylindricalBlocks() class. 

From the objects of the cuboidBlocks() class, we now derive spherical objects, sphericalBlocks(), whose diameters equal the width, height or length of the respective cuboid objects they are derived from.
