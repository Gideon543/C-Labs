Problem Description: 

Consider a 2-Dimensional integer array A[101][101] of dimensions 101×101. 2000 indices i,j are generated randomly so that each i and j is uniformly distributed in the interval [0,100]. Initially the elements A[i][j] are assigned unde?ned values of your choice. For each pair of random indices i,j generated, if the corresponding element A[i][j] is unde?ned, a count of 1 is assigned otherwise the element count is increased by 1.

 After 2000 generated pairs of indices i,j some entries in the array will be unde?ned, some will have positive values of count = 1 as shown in the Figure 1. Given an array populated as above, and a rectangular covering region, as shown in blue, the problem is to report the coordinates or indices i,j of the entries with positive counts and the values of the respective counts. 

The rectangular bounding box is speci?ed by giving the coordinates of the lower left and the upper right diagonal corners. In the illustrative Figure 1, these will be h2,3,5,5i. The search in the bounding box should yield the result
